# CS Hangout Website Project

## New User Guide

Welcome to the CS Hangout Website project! Whether you are here to browse or contribute, glad you made it!  
If you are just here to browse or run the program locally, check out the wiki page entitled "Running The Program".
If you are here to contribute, take a look below at our contribution guidelines, our board to see what stories
are needing to be worked, then dive right in. Happy coding!

### New User Contribution Guidelines

To help guarantee the integrity and efficiency of the project, we have gathered some documentation that all new developers should
read before contributing. These docs have been marked required and suggested and all can be found in the repo's wiki. Required will help you
avoid having pull requests denied. Suggested will make you a better programmer.

Once you have completed the reading, head over to the board and see what stories are waiting to be worked, grab one, and dive in.

#### Required Documentation

These docs should be read before contributing:

-   MVP Goal
-   Stack Details
-   Coding Guidelines
-   Pull Request Process

#### Suggested Documentation

-   SOLID Principles
-   Unit Testing Best Practices
