# Welcome!
Welcome to the CS-Hangout-Website project!

This project is designed to give SNHU students exposure to a variety of "real world" programming experiences. While the end product will be useful to current and future students, the primary goal is to give contributors the opportunity to learn what it is like to work on a software development team. Additionally, this repository will remain public so you can reference it on your resumes and discuss it in future interviews.

This project has a low barrier for entry and will be accessible to anyone who has the desire to learn. The stack may be new to you, or the concepts may be foreign, but I will make sure to work with anyone who wants to contribute to help you gain the skills necessary to make this project a success.

I look forward to working with all of you and hope we all learn from this process!
